# Aurora4xAutomation
command line for aurora

Basically a command line interface for Aurora. Originally built in response to the "Shipping company xyz just made freighter 789! I'll stop the entire game, just for you!" spam.

Can access the database, but you'll need the password. No, I will not give you the password.

This software actively clicks on the screen, moves around windows, and does all sorts of other crazy stuff. You will need to run it in adminstrator mode. You will need to play using the Aurora wrapper. You will need to have your selected game open (it won't figure that out for you, yet). I'm sure theres a million other environment specific issues you can run into.
